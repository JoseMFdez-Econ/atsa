## Simple linear regression

Here is a simple linear regression model

$$
y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + e_i ~ \text{with} ~ e_i \sim \text{N}(0,\sigma^2)
$$


## Simple linear regression

The righthand side of the equation is composed of _deterministic_ and _stochastic_ pieces

$$
y_i = \underbrace{\alpha + \beta x_i}_{\text{deterministic}} + \underbrace{e_i}_{\text{stochastic}}
$$


## Simple linear regression

This can also be seen by rewriting the model 

$$
y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + e_i ~ \text{with} ~ e_i \sim \text{N}(0,\sigma^2)
$$

as

$$
y_i \sim \text{N}(\alpha + \beta x_i,\sigma^2)
$$


## Simple linear regression

Sometime these pieces are referred to as _fixed_ and _random_

$$
y_i = \underbrace{\alpha + \beta x_i}_{\text{fixed}} + \underbrace{e_i}_{\text{random}}
$$
