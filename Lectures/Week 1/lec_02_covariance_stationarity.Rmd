## Topics for today

### Characteristics of time series (ts)
* Expectation, mean & variance
* Covariance & correlation
* Stationarity
* Autocovariance & autocorrelation
* Correlograms
* White noise
* Random walks
* Backshift & difference operators


## Expectation, mean & variance

The expectation (E) of a variable is its mean value in the population

$\text{E}(x) \equiv~\text{mean of }x = \mu$

$\text{E}([x - \mu]^2) \equiv~\text{mean deviations of x about } \mu$

$\text{E}([x - \mu]^2) \equiv \text{variance of } x~(\sigma^2)$

Can estimate s2 from sample as
