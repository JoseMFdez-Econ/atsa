## Topics for today

### Characteristics of time series (ts)
* What is a ts?
* Classifying ts
* Trends
* Seasonality (periodicity)
    
### Classical decomposition


## What is a time series?

### A set of observations taken sequentially in time


##  

### A ts can be represented as a set

$$
\{ x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n \} 
$$

### For example,
$$
\{ 10,31,27,42,53,15 \}
$$

## Classification of time series | By some _index set_

Interval across real time; $x(t)$    

* begin/end: $t \in [1.1,2.5]$    


## Classification of time series | By some _index set_

Discrete time; $x_t$    

* Equally spaced: $t = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$  
* Equally spaced w/ missing value: $t = \{1,2,4,5,6\}$  
* Unequally spaced: $t = \{2,3,4,6,9\}$  


## Classification of time series | By the _underlying process_    

Discrete (eg, total # of fish caught per trawl)

Continuous (eg, salinity, temperature)


## Classification of time series | By the _number of values recorded_    

Univariate/scalar (eg, total # of fish caught)    

Multivariate/vector (eg, # of each spp of fish caught)


## Classification of time series | By the _type of values recorded_    

Integer (eg, # of fish in 5 min trawl = 2413)

Rational (eg, fraction of unclipped fish = 47/951)

Real (eg, fish mass = 10.2 g)

Complex (eg, cos(2π2.43) + _i_ sin(2π2.43))


## Statistical analyses of time series

Most statistical analyses are concerned with estimating properties of a population from a sample

For example, we use fish caught in a seine to infer the mean size of fish in a lake



## Statistical analyses of time series

Time series analysis, however, presents a different situation:

* Although we could vary the _length_ of an observed time series, it is often impossible to make multiple observations at a _given_ point in time

For example, one can’t observe today’s closing price of Microsoft stock more than once  

Thus, conventional statistical procedures, based on large sample estimates, are inappropriate


## Descriptions of time series

```{r ex_ts_plot_www, fig.cap = "Number of users connected to the internet"}
data(WWWusage)
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(WWWusage, ylab = "", las = 1)
```


## Descriptions of time series

```{r ex_ts_plot_lynx, fig.cap = "Number of lynx trapped in Canada from 1821-1934"}
data(lynx)
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(lynx, ylab = "", las = 1)
```
