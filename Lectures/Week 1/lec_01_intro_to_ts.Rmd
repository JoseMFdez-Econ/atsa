## Topics for today

### Characteristics of time series (ts)
* What is a ts?
* Classifying ts
* Trends
* Seasonality (periodicity)
    
### Classical decomposition


## What is a time series?

### A set of observations taken sequentially in time


##  

### A ts can be represented as a set

$$
\{ x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n \} 
$$

### For example,
$$
\{ 10,31,27,42,53,15 \}
$$

## Classification of time series

### By some _index set_

* Interval across real time; $x(t)$  
    - begin/end: $t \in [1.1,2.5]$  


## Classification of time series

### By some _index set_

* Interval across real time; $x(t)$  
    - begin/end: $t \in [1.1,2.5]$  

* Discrete time; $x_t$
    - Equally spaced: $t = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$
    - Equally spaced w/ missing value: $t = \{1,2,4,5,6\}$
    - Unequally spaced: $t = \{2,3,4,6,9\}$
