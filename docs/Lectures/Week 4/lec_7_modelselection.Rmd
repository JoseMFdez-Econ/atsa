## Overview of today's material

* Approaches for model selection 
* Cross validation
* Quantifying forecast performance

## How good are our models? 

Several candidate models might be built based on

* hypotheses / mechanisms
* diagnostics / summaries of fit

Models can be evaluated by their ability to explain data

* OR by the tradeoff in the ability to explain data, and ability to predict future data
* OR just in their predictive abilities
    + Hindcasting
    + Forecasting

## How good are our models? 

We can illustrate with an example to the `harborSealWA` dataset in MARSS
```{r}
data(harborSealWA)
harborSealWA = harborSealWA[,c(1,3)]
harborSealWA=as.data.frame(harborSealWA)
ggplot(harborSealWA, aes(Year, SJI)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line() + ylab("ln abundance (San Juan Islands") 
```

## How good are our models?

Metrics like the sum of squares are appealing,

$$SS=\sum _{ i=1 }^{ n }{ { \left( y_{ i }-E[{ y }_{ i }] \right)  }^{ 2 } } $$

## How good are our models?

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
summary(lm(SJI~Year, data=harborSealWA))
```

## How good are our models?
Our regression model had a pretty good sum-of-squares

* But SS is problematic
    + as we consider more complex models, they'll inevitably reduce SS
    + there's no cost or penalty for having too many parameters

## Model selection

Lots of metrics have been developed to overcome this issue and penalize complex models

* **Occam's razor**: "the law of briefness"

* **Principle of parsimony**: choose the simplest possible model that explains the data pretty well
    + choose a model that minimizes bias *and* variance

## Model selection: AIC

Akaike's Information Criterion (**AIC**, Akaike 1973)

* Attempts to balance the goodness of fit of the model against the number of parameters

* Based on deviance = minus twice negative log likelihood

Deviance = $$-2\cdot ln\left( L(\underline { \theta } |\underline { y  } ) \right)$$

* Deviance is a measure of model fit to data
    + lower values are better
    + Maximizing likelihood is equivalent to minimizing negative likelihood

## Model selection: AIC

Many *IC approaches to model selection also rely on deviance. Where they differ is how they structure the penalty term. 

For AIC, the penalty is 2 * number of parameters ($k$),

$$AIC = -2\cdot ln\left( L(\underline { \theta } |\underline { y  } ) \right) + 2k$$

* But what about sample size, $n$? 

## Model selection: AIC

Small sample AIC

$$AICc=AIC+\frac { 2k(k+1) }{ n-k-1 }$$

* What happens to this term as n increases? 

## Model selection: AIC

AIC aims to find the best model to predict data generated from the same process that generated your observations

Downside: AIC has a tendency to overpenalize, especially for more complex models

* Equivalent to significance test w/ $\alpha$ = 0.16

Alternative: Schwarz/Bayesian Information Criterion (SIC/BIC)

* Not Bayesian!
* Relies on Laplace approximation to posterior
* $\alpha$ becomes a function of sample size
 
## Model selection: AIC 

BIC is measure of explanatory power (rather than balancing explanation / prediction)

$$BIC = -2\cdot ln\left( L(\underline { \theta } |\underline { y  } ) \right) + k\cdot ln(n)$$

* Tendency of BIC to underpenalize

## Model selection: AIC

Philosophical differences between AIC / BIC

* AIC / AICc tries to choose a model that approximates reality
    + does not assume that reality exists in your set of candidate models

* BIC assumes that one of your models is truth
    + This model will tend to be favored more as sample size increases

## Model selection: AIC

Many base functions in R support the extraction of AIC

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
y = cumsum(rnorm(20))
AIC(lm(y~1))
AIC(glm(y~1))
AIC(mgcv::gam(y~1))
AIC(glmmTMB::glmmTMB(y~1))
AIC(lme4::lmer(y~1))
AIC(stats::arima(y))
AIC(forecast::Arima(y))
```

## Bayesian model selection 

Largely beyond the scope of this class, but as an overview there's several options

* Bayes factors (approximated by BIC)
    + can be very difficult to calculate for complex models

* Deviance Information Criterion (DIC)
    + Spiegelhalter et al. (2002) 
    + DIC is easy to get out of some programs (JAGS)
    
DIC is also attempting to balance bias and variance

## Bayesian model selection 

Like AIC, DIC is estimated from (1) the deviance, and (2) penalty, or effective number of parameters $p_{D}$. 
$$DIC = -2\cdot ln\left( L(\underline { \theta } |\underline { y  } ) \right) + 2p_{D}$$
Options for $p_{D}$ are 

* $E[D]-D\left( \bar { \theta  } \right)$ (Spiegelhalter et al. 2002) and 

* $\frac { Var(D\left( \theta  \right) ) }{ 2 }$ (Gelman et al. 2004)

## Bayesian model selection

The big difference between the Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches are that

* ML methods are maximizing the likelihood over the parameter space
* Bayesian methods are integrating over the parameter space, asking 'what values are best, on average?'

Many of the ML methods discussed were designed for models with only fixed effects.

* What about correlated parameters, nested or hierarchical models?

## Cross validation

Recent focus in ecology & fisheries on prediction

## Resampling techniques

**Jackknife**

* Hold out each data point, recomputing some statistic (and then average across 1:n)

**Bootstrap**

* Similar to jackknife, but with resampling

**Cross-validation (k-fold)**

* Divide dataset into k-partitions
* How well do (k-1) partitions predict kth set of points?
* Relationship between LOOCV and AIC

**Data split**: test/training sets (e.g. holdout last 5 data pts)

## Resampling techniques

Bootstrap or jackknife approaches are useful

* generally used in the context of time series models to generate new or pseudo-datasets

* state space models: use estimated deviations / errors to simulate, estimate CIs

Examples
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
MARSS::MARSSboot()
MARSS::MARSSinnovationsboot()
forecast::bld.mbb.bootstrap()
forecast::forecast(..., bootstrap=TRUE)
```


## Resampling techniques

As an example, we'll use a time series of body temperature from the `beavers` dataset

```{r echo=TRUE}
data(beavers)
beaver = dplyr::filter(beaver2, time>200)
```

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=2}
ggplot(beaver, aes(time, temp)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line() + 
  ylab("Temperature") + xlab("Time")
```

## Resampling techniques: K-fold cross validation

* Choose model (e.g. regression)
* Partition data
* Fit & prediction

Things to highlight: # folds, how sampling is done
```{r echo=TRUE}
K = 5 
beaver$part = sample(1:K, size=nrow(beaver), replace=T)
beaver$pred = 0
for(i in 1:K) {
	mod = lm(temp~time, data = beaver[beaver$part!=i,])
	beaver$pred[beaver$part==i] = 
	predict(mod, newdata = beaver[beaver$part==i,])
}

```

## Resampling techniques: K-fold cross validation

```{r}
plot(beaver$time, beaver$temp,lwd=2)
points(beaver$time, beaver$pred, col="red",lwd=2)
lines(beaver$time, lm(temp~time, data=beaver)$fitted.values, 
col="grey", lwd=3)
legend("topleft", c("Obs","CV","lm"), lty=c(NA,NA,1), lwd=c(2,2,3),col=c("black","red","grey"),pch=c(21,21,NA))
```


## Resampling techniques: K-fold cross validation

* How large should K be?

* Bias/variance tradeoff:

* Low K: low variance, larger bias, quicker to run. ML approaches recommend 5-10

* High K (LOOCV): low bias, high variance, computationally expensive


## Resampling techniques: repeated K-fold cross validation

* To remove effect of random sampling / partitioning, repeat K-fold cross validation and average predictions for a given data point

* caret() package in R

## Resampling techniques: repeated K-fold cross validation

* Need to specify repeats

```{r echo=TRUE}
train_control = caret::trainControl(method="repeatedcv", 
                number=5, repeats=20)
```

* Again this is extendable across many widely used models

```{r}
model = train(temp~time, 
              data=beaver, 
              trControl=train_control, method="lm")
```

## Resampling techniques: repeated K-fold cross validation

```{r echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
summary(model)
```

## Resampling techniques

What about for time series data?

* Previous resampling was random
* No preservation of order (autocorrelation)

## Resampling techniques: forward chain CV

Idea: only evaluate models on subsequent data

* Fold 1: training[1], test[2]
* Fold 2: training[1:2], test[3]
* Fold 3: training[1:3], test[4]
* Fold 4: training[1:4], test[5]

## Resampling techniques: forward chain CV

Example with Arima(1,1,1) model 

* Assign partitions in order, 1:5

```{r echo=TRUE}
beaver$part = ceiling(5*seq(1,nrow(beaver)) / (nrow(beaver)))
```

* iterate through 2:5 fitting the model and forecasting

## Resampling techniques: forward chain CV

Example code:

```{r echo=TRUE}
for(i in 2:5) {
mod = Arima(beaver$temp[which(beaver$part < i)], order=c(1,1,1))

beaver$pred[which(beaver$part == i)] = 
  as.numeric(forecast(mod, h = length(which(beaver$part == i)))$mean)
}

```

## Bayesian cross validation

LOOCV (Leave-one out cross validation) 
    + preferred over alternatives

WAIC (widely applicable information criterion)

* Both available in `loo::loo()`

## Prediction and forecast evaluations

## Forecasting with arima()

* Letâ€™s fit an ARMA(1,1) model to the global temperature data, after 1st differencing to remove trend

* You can use the arima() function or Arima() function â€“ Arima() is a wrapper for arima() 

```{r}
plot(globtemp)
```

## Forecasting with arima()

Seasonal component not included because these data are collected annually

```{r echo=TRUE}
ar.global.1 = Arima(globtemp, order = c(1,1,1),
              seasonal=list(order=c(0,0,0),
              period=12))

f1 = forecast(ar.global.1, h = 10)
```

* h = number of time steps to forecast in future


## Forecasting with arima()

```{r echo=TRUE, results='markdown'}
summary(f1)
```

## Forecasting with arima()


```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(f1)
```

## Quantifying forecast performance

One of the most widelty used metrics is mean square error (MSE)

$$MSE=E\left[ { e }_{ t }^{ 2 } \right] =E\left[ { \left( { x }_{ t }-{ \hat { x }  }_{ t } \right)  }^{ 2 } \right]$$

* Root mean squared error (RMSE) also very common

## Quantifying forecast performance

Like with model selection, the bias-variance tradeoff is important

* principle of parsimony

MSE can be rewritten as 

$$MSE=Var\left( { \hat { x }  }_{ t } \right) +Bias{ \left( { x }_{ t },{ \hat { x }  }_{ t } \right)  }^{ 2 }$$
* Smaller MSE = lower bias + variance

## Quantifying forecast performance

MSE and all forecast metrics can be calculated for 

* single data points
* entire time series
* future forecasts

$$MSE={ \frac { \sum _{ t=1 }^{ n }{ { \left( { x }_{ t }-{ \hat { x }  }_{ t } \right)  }^{ 2 } }  }{ n }  }$$

* Do you care just about predicting the final outcome of a forecast, or also the trajectory to get there? 

## Variants of MSE

Root mean square error, RMSE (quadratic score)

* RMSE = $\sqrt { RMSE }$
* on the same scale as the data
* also referred to as RMSD, root mean square deviation

Mean absolute error, MAE (linear score)
$$E\left[ \left| { x }_{ t }-{ \hat { x }  }_{ t }  \right|  \right]$$

Median absolute error, MdAE

$$median\left[ \left| { x }_{ t }-{ \hat { x }  }_{ t } \right|  \right]$$

## Scale independent measures of performance

Better when applying statistics of model(s) to multiple datasets
MSE or RMSE will be driven by time series that is larger in magnitude 
```{r fig.height=4}
set.seed(123)
df = data.frame("Year"=1:20, "Abundance"=10+cumsum(rnorm(20)), 
                "Population"=1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df2 = data.frame("Year"=1:20, "Abundance"=5+cumsum(rnorm(20)), 
                "Population"=2, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

df = rbind(df, df2)
df$Population = as.factor(df$Population)
ggplot(df, aes(Year, Abundance, group=Population, color=Population)) + geom_line()
```

## 

```{r, out.width = "800px", results="markdown"}
knitr::include_graphics(path="wing_sales.jpg")
```

## Percent Error Statistics

Percent Error: 

$${ p }_{ t }=\frac { { e }_{ t }\cdot 100 }{ { Y }_{ t } }$$

Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE):

$$MAPE\quad =\quad E\left[ \left| { p }_{ t } \right|  \right]$$
Root Mean Square Percent Error (RMSPE):

$$RMSPE\quad =\quad \sqrt { E\left[ { p }_{ t }^{ 2 } \right]  }$$

## Issues with percent error statistics

* What happens when Y = 0? 

* Distribution of percent errors tends to be highly skewed / long tails

* MAPE tends to put higher penalty on positive errors 

* See Hyndman & Koehler (2006)

## Scaled error statistics

Define scaled error as 

$${ q }_{ t }=\frac { { e }_{ t } }{ \frac { 1 }{ n-1 } \sum _{ i=2 }^{ n }{ \left( { Y }_{ i }-{ Y }_{ i-1 } \right)  }  }$$

* denominator is MAE from random walk model, so performance is gauged relative to that
* this does not allow for missing data

Absolute scaled error (ASE)

$$ASE=\left| { q }_{ t } \right|$$
Mean absolute scaled error (MASE) 

$$MASE=E\left[ \left| { q }_{ t } \right|  \right]$$

## Interpreting ASE and MASE

All values are relative to the naÃ¯ve random walk model

* Values < 1 indicate better performance than RW model

* Values > 1 indicate worse performance than RW model

## Implementation in R

* Fit an ARIMA model to â€˜airmilesâ€™,holding out last 3 points

```{r echo=TRUE}
n = length(airmiles)
air.model = auto.arima(log(airmiles[1:(n-3)]))
```

## Implementation in R

* Forecast the fitted model 3 steps ahead
* Use holdout data to evaluate accuracy 

```{r echo=TRUE, results='markdown'}
air.forecast = forecast(air.model, h = 3)
plot(air.forecast)
```

## Implementation in R

Evaluate RMSE / MASE statistics for 3 holdouts

```{r echo=TRUE, results='markdown'}
accuracy(air.forecast, log(airmiles[(n-2):n]), test = 3)
```

Evaluate RMSE / MASE statistics for only last holdout
```{r echo=TRUE, results='markdown'}
accuracy(air.forecast, log(airmiles[(n-2):n]), test = 1)
```

# Performance metrics summary

Raw statistics (e.g. MSE, RMSE) shouldnâ€™t be applied for data of different scale

Percent error metrics (e.g. MAPE) may be skewed & undefined for real zeroes

Scaled error metrics (ASE, MASE) have been shown to be more robust meta-analyses of many datasets
