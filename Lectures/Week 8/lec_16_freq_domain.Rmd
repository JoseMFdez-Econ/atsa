## Topics for today

What is the frequency domain?

Fourier transforms

Spectral analysis

Wavelets


## Fourier series

Complex periodic functions can be written as infinite sums of sine and cosine waves

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2} a_0 + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty [a_n \cos(n t) + b_n \sin(n t)] 
$$

## Fourier transform

We can make use of Euler's formula

$$
\cos(2 \pi \theta) + i \sin(2 \pi \theta) = e^{2 \pi i \theta}
$$

and write the Fourier transform of $f(t)$ as

$$
f(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat{f}(\theta) ~ e^{2 \pi i t \theta} ~ d \theta
$$

where $\theta$ is the frequency
